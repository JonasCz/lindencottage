            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This beautiful 400-year-old stone cottage in the quiet hamlet of Les Groleaux
              in St Astier de Duras is the perfect place to relax from the usual demands
              of the fast-paced lives we lead. While many of the older features of this
              two-storey property have been retained, it has been renovated with all
              the modern conveniences needed to provide a home-from-home experience.</p>
            <p>The spacious kitchen and dining room with their beautiful arch divider
              have all the conveniences of modern life: dishwasher, double cooker, fridge
              freezer, iron and board, coffee maker, soda maker etc. There is a beautiful
              veranda surrounding the entire house which captures both sun and shade
              at different times of the day so you get the sense of the house itself
              as a living thing. It is lovely to eat outside with the local birds offering
              background music for your pleasure.</p>
            <p>The house has three spacious bedrooms one of which is en suite. Each room
              has a double bed and there are two single beds in one of the rooms. The
              house is set on its own grounds with about an acre of well tended land.
              There are lots of quiet tree-shaded areas under which to sit or laze in
              a hammock. There is also a beautiful mature lily pond with its gently flowing
              water teeming with goldfish and the occasional croak of the frog inhabitants,
              all of which add to the peace and tranquility of the area.</p>
            <p>For those of you who like to sit quietly or enjoy some yoga or gentle
              stretching there is a lovely spacious meditation room which overlooks the
              lily-pond. This facility will be of special interest to those of you keen
              to visit Plum Village, the renowned Zen Centre of Thich Nhat Hanh, which
              is only 7km away.</p>
            <p>During the hot summer days you have the use of a small swimming pool to
              cool you down and a decked area where you can simply sit and enjoy the
              swaying bamboos that offer a wall of privacy beside the pool. For more
              energetic moments table tennis facilities are also available. For the colder
              days the house is heated throughout with radiators and a cosy wood burning
              stove. Wifi is available and there is ample parking.</p>
            <p>The closest village is St Sernin about 2 km away. It has a small bar/tabac
              general store and small weekly market. It also has well-maintained tennis
              courts which are available to rent on an hourly basis (we provide tennis
              raquets). The beautiful town of Duras is a short drive away and you will
              recognise it with its imposing Chateau; it has 2 lively weekly markets.
              The town of Ste Foy La Grande is a 20 minute drive away and it has a bustling
              Saturday market and lots of restaurants as well the local railway station
              for trains between Bordeaux and Bergerac. The lovely Bastide town of Eymet
              is also about a 20 minutes drive away and it too has 2 weekly markets and
              some lovely restaurants.</p>
            <p>If you are an outdoor enthusiast there is lots for you to do. There are
              many local marked walking routes (randonnées). Bicycles can be hired in
              Duras and there are opportunities for kayaking, golf and even for the adventure
              of hot air ballooning.</p>
            <p>For wine and history lovers you are not too far away from the UNESCO world
              heritage site of Saint-Emilion. This is a great way to spend a day exploring
              the various chateaux and getting a sense of the history of the area. The
              home of the mediaeval scholar Montaigne is in the same region. As he is
              the most significant philosopher of the French Renaissance, it is a fascinating
              way to spend an afternoon roaming his chateau, including his attic writing
              room and his private chapel, and the gardens.</p>
            <p>It goes without saying, given the region, that the food and wine is sublime
              and there are many restaurants to please the palate.</p>
